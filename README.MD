# Confluence Float TOC

## Description
The Confluence Float TOC plugin is a user script implemented using Tampermonkey. It enhances the Confluence documentation experience by providing a floating table of contents (TOC) that stays visible as you scroll through the page.

## Features
- Floating table of contents: The plugin adds a floating TOC to the Confluence pages, allowing users to easily navigate through the document.
- Automatic generation: The TOC is automatically generated based on the headings in the document, making it easy to keep the TOC up to date.
- Smooth scrolling: Clicking on a TOC entry smoothly scrolls the page to the corresponding section.

## Installation

1. Install a user script manager extension such as Tampermonkey in your browser.
2. Open the script manager and create a new script.
3. Copy the contents of the `main.js` file from this repository.
4. Paste the copied contents into the script editor.
5. Save the script and refresh any open Confluence pages.

## Usage
Once the plugin is installed, the floating TOC will automatically appear on Confluence pages. You can click on the TOC entries to navigate to the corresponding sections of the document.
